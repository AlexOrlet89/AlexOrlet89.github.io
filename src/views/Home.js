        When I first downloaded my singing monsters I would play before and
        after work and progress just fine, great game to kill time. I showed
        this game to my colleagues and family, and soon the people around me
        started enjoying the game with me. During dinner time with the family,
        we would all play my singing monsters and progress together. This became
        a fun bonding experience with me and my family, as I am rarely home due
        to work. This game gave me the much needed time to bond with my wife and
        kids. The monsters were fun, the breeding was anticipating, the
        progression was slow yet rewarding. All nice qualities, I found myself
        especially interested with the monsters, but more specifically the
        monster called 'toe jammer'. The sound, the appearance of the monster
        was all very appealing to me. When people asked me what my favourite
        monster is I would without hesitation respond with 'toe jammer'. He was
        by far my favourite, I liked the blue translucent colour of it, I liked
        the funny idea of the character. My wife bought me a toe jammer stuffed
        toy for my birthday this year, and I couldn't of been more grateful.
        Now, please spare your criticism on this next part. I'm scared to speak
        out about this and it's very vulnerable for me. My wife hadn't been home
        for over a week, she was out on a very extensive business trip. And I
        was without a doubt very sexually frustrated, it had been a while since
        me and my wife had shared an intimate moment with each other. And,
        shamefully I got off to my toe jammer stuffed toy she got for me. I
        don't know why I did it, why I chose toe jammer to be the subject of my
        sexual frustration but I did. On nights where my wife wasn't home it
        became habit to use my toe jammer stuffed toy as an outlet for my needs.

        I spoke to my wife about wanting more intimate times with her, in which
        she obliged, she shared that she felt the same way. It was refreshing to
        know my feelings were reciprocated, on that night me and my wife spent
        the night together engaging in intercourse. However at times, I would
        imagine that my wife was actually toe jammer. I felt guilty for this
        obviously, it was a weird sexual fantasy that I just couldn't get rid
        of. More and more nights we shared I just couldn't stop imaging my wife
        as toe jammer. Something about that character captivated me so sexually,
        it's so shameful. It really is, and it's greatly embarrassing. One night
        when me and my wife were having sex I accidentally called her toe
        jammer, in which her response was shocked and confused. Followed by a
        very intense lunch conversation on the next day, I opened up about my
        sexual fantasies revolving toe jammer to my wife and she reassured me
        that she's okay with it and understands. However, over the following
        weeks she began to act strange towards me. avoiding me whenever
        possible, avoiding eye contact, and denying opportunities for intimacy.
        I brought this up to her one night and she expressed to me that she's
        struggling to find me attractive after I opened up about my fantasies.
        It's been a month since that conversation, we're falling out and our
        kids are distressed. Toe jammer has ruined my love life and I don't know
        what he'll ruin next. I don't know what to do and I've been greatly
        stressed out.
